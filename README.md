#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This **Restaurant Reviews** project, required that I  incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One** of this project, I had to take a static design that had no accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. In addition, I aslo added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for all users.

### Specification

I was provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. However, the code had a lot of issues and was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didnâ€™t include any standard accessibility features, and it would not work offline at all. My goal was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Running this project

Download or clone the repository to your local computer using:

https://github.com/sdrharris/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git

1. In your repository folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal (e.g. Git Bash, VS Code terminal), check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software (or go to extensions in VS Code and search Python, then install Python and Python Extension Pack then restart your VS Code.).

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, where you will be able to view the live site.
